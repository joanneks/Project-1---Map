## **Overview**
---

The main purpose of this website is to aid users in their search of a HDB and discover the amenities around their potential/future house.

### **Target Audience**

The users mainly refer to resale HDB flat buyers and BTO/SBF flat buyers. 

Other types of home buyers (such as condominium or landed properties) may also find some features of the website to be applicable for their use.

| No. | User Goals |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Discover what amenities are nearby (based on the circle marker, in which the radius is set by the user) and determine if it has their desired amenities. This will help them rationalise if the flat they are considering is suitable a location for them to stay in the next 0-10 years.|
| 2 | View the recent last transacted resale flats around the considered flat block for the price sold, commencement year, flat area and level. This is used to determine the approximate current prices and if the seller is asking for a high price. If yes, is it worth to pay the premium for the amenities and location? If no, is the location and amenities around what the user wants?|
| 3 | They can search for the flat block that they are considering and their parents' house to see if they can get the Proximity Housing Grant from HDB. |

Through the website, buyers should be able to make informed decisions on what their budget and price should be for the location and amenities around.

### **Organisation's Goals**

Organisation aims to promote awareness of the current HDB prices in Singapore to reduce the acceleration in prices of the HDB resale market. 

This is done with the aim that:

1. It will help prevent uninformed buyers from paying an exorbitantly high premium for a fringe case, which will ultimately lead to increases in the overall pricing of the HDB Resale Market if it continues.

2. It will encourage users to buy SBFs/BTOs or resale flats in non-mature estates due to the high prices seen in mature areas. Thereby, reducing the increase in the overall pricing of the HDB Resale Market.
