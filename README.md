| BTO/SBF flat buyers | Text |

Through the website, buyers should be able to make informed decisions on what their budget and price should be for the location and amenities around.

### **Organisation's Goals**

Organisation aims to promote awareness of the current HDB prices in Singapore to reduce the acceleration in prices of the HDB resale market. 

This is done with the aim that:

1. It will help prevent uninformed buyers from paying an exorbitantly high premium for a fringe case, which will ultimately lead to increases in the overall pricing of the HDB Resale Market if it continues.

2. It will encourage users to buy SBFs/BTOs or resale flats in non-mature estates due to the high prices seen in mature areas. Thereby, reducing the increase in the overall pricing of the HDB Resale Market.
